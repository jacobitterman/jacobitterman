👋 Greetings fellow code enthusiasts! I’m Jacob Bitterman, an algorithm developer and manager, with a past expertise in operations research. 
My journey into the captivating world of coding began 15 years ago, sparked by a single computer science lesson back in high school, and I haven’t looked back since!

⚡ Fun fact: Beyond the lines of code, I'm a die-hard fan of Macabbi Tel Aviv. 
From the intense courtside battles of basketball🏀 to the thrilling rallies of volleyball🏐, the adrenaline-fueled clashes of football⚽, the gripping showdowns of handball🤾‍♂️, and yes, even the finesse of Mikado🥢, I’m all in!

You can catch up with me on [X](https://x.com/jaking921), connect with me professionally on [LinkedIn](https://il.linkedin.com/in/jacob-bitterman), or stay tuned for updates on my upcoming blog (WIP).
